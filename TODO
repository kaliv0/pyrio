- check if you need explicit __init__ in child classes

- Iterator -> concat with dict
    -> previously iterated over the keys only
    -> currently returns key/val tuples
    -> created separate method -> concat_dict -> yields Items instead of tuples

- FileStream -> rename of()/of_csv() methods -> process, read etc
- add flag 'raw' -> not to convert dict items to Item classes (could be used in normal Stream with default false)
- add **kwargs to csv methods
- add save to file method -> override same file or create new -> prompt for name etc
