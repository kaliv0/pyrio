- Stream.builder (?)
- reduce returns Optional -> to handle emtpy streams?
- add function in to_dict to resolve duplicate keys -> also in collect() with dict
- add combiner in reduce
- filter_map (Rust-like) should only filter None?
    -> pass bool to skip all Falsy values???
- and_then, or_else, or_throw, catch (after map -> see Amnis)
- throw IllegalStateException: stream has already been operated upon or closed
- rename 'function' arg to 'operator'?
