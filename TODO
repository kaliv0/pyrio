add methods:
- map_multi
- or_else_raise
- Result pattern -> research how to integrate inside pipeline?
- range -> for numbers (move to separate int_stream?)
    -> could it work for chars e.g. alphabet?
- average
- summary_statistics -> see java
- FileStream for regular text files -> read lines into iterable of strings
- iterate -> with predicate
- gatherers ??

- introduce Int/FloatStream?

- rename sort() back to sorted() ??

- split bigger tests with multiple asserts;
    add tests for DictItem

- add to README and docs:
    - take_first/last
    - close, on_close
    - collect(str), to_string, repr -> update

- if typehints are added  -> use return annotation to determine
    which Stream methods are terminating -> not returning self
