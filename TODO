- add to README and docs:
    - take_first
    - take_last
    - close, on_close
    - collect(str), to_string, repr -> update
    - average
    - iterate -> with predicate -> update
    - range -> all overloads
    - enumerate
    - Stream(None), Stream.of_nullable()
    - leetcode examples at the end
split docs?

file_stream:
    - DictReader receives *args only too -> currently not passed by **f_read_options
    - should private methods also have kwargs-only params as process() and save()?
