- Stream.builder (?)
- add combiner in reduce
- and_then, or_throw, catch (after map -> see Amnis)

- add description in readme for explicit kwargs (filter_map, sorted)

- write tests for errors
- write more tests for optional

- add 'head' (alias for 'limit') for consistency with 'tail'

- rename (currently) private 'recipe' methods in ItertoolsMixin
- add same default values in Iterator methods as in Stream APIs

-----------------
integrate itertools:
    - accumulate -> 'func' in signature, 'function' in docs
