- Iterator -> refactor other methods similar to map() -> if iterable is dict -> iterate over it's items
    - could it be handled with another decorator??
- check if you need explicit __init__ in child classes

- FileStream -> rename of()/of_csv() methods -> process, read etc
- add flag 'raw' -> not to convert dict items to Item classes (could be used in normal Stream with default false)
- add **kwargs to csv methods
- add save to file method -> override same file or create new -> prompt for name etc
