add methods:
- Result pattern -> research how to integrate inside pipeline?
- FileStream for regular text files -> read lines into iterable of strings

- decide if Stream(None) should raise or only Stream.of
    -> handle tests

- rename modules in decorators dir -> dispatcher, handler etc

- split bigger tests with multiple asserts;
    add tests for DictItem
    rewrite all test raises with match=err_msg?

- add to README and docs:
    - take_first/last
    - close, on_close
    - collect(str), to_string, repr -> update
    - average
    - iterate -> with predicate -> update
    - or_else_raise? -> part ot Optional API
    - range -> all overloads
    - enumerate
    - Stream.of(None), Stream.of_nullable()
        - Stream(None)??
